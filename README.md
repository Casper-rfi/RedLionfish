Red lionfish (RL) deconvolution

Deconvolution algorithms for busy scientists who would like to do Richardson-Lucy (also RL) deconvolution.

It has a version that runs on CPU (scikit) and another that runs on GPU using OpenCL through Reikna library.

If you wish to do RL using GPU openCL using large data, then the 'block' version is recommended to prevent out of memory errors
