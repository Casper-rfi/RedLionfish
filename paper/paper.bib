	abstract = {napari 0.4.14 We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.14! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). This is a small release containing some new features and fixing a few issues that have come up since 0.4.13 was released. This release adds the ability to convert a shapes layer to a labels layer from a context menu available on right clicking the layer list entry (\#3978). Our vectors layer has gained the ability to render vectors in 2D across multiple slices (\#2902) and points in the points layer can now be hidden individually (\#3625). For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website: https://github.com/napari/napari Complete list of changes below: Highlights Enable shapes layer (right click) \&gt; convert to labels (\#3978) Out-of-slice rendering for Vectors (\#2902) Hide points individually (\#3625) New Features Improvements Update tests to remove warnings (\#3974) Add test to check that things are removed properly (\#3996) Change base point slice thickness to half a unit (\#3997) Change base vector slice thickness to half a unit (\#4001) Use scikit-image[data] in the bundle (\#4024) Rename n\_dimensional to out\_of\_slice\_display in Points and Vectors (\#4007) Raise reader plugin errors sooner, (avoid cryptic error messages) (\#4026) Unlink close button from plugins (\#4027) Update QtProgressBar total when progress total is changed (\#4034) Update on merge to stack action ordering (\#4033) Bug Fixes Fix about on python 3.10 (\#3972) Revert changes to scikit-image test API (\#3979) Fix missing builtins in bundle (\#3982) Don't use texture\_format auto if float textures not available on machine (\#3990) Fix error when setting ndisplay=3 with empty shapes layer in viewer (\#4003) Fix bug preventing close button on dock widgets (\#4006) Fix point symbol on instantiation (\#4043) Only set dims kwargs on viewer after adding layer API Changes Deprecations Build Tools and Docs DOC: Misc doc syntax.

	abstract = {Previous models for emission tomography (ET) do not distinguish the physics of ET from that of transmission tomography. We give a more accurate general mathematical model for ET where an unknown emission density lambda = lambda(x, y, z) generates, and is to be reconstructed from, the number of counts n(*)(d) in each of D detector units d. Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate lambdainsertion mark of lambda which maximizes the probability p(n(*){\textbar}lambda) of observing the actual detector count data n(*) over all possible densities lambda. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means lambda(b), b = 1, ..., B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter. Suppose each emission in box b is detected in detector unit d with probability p(b, d), d = 1, ..., D with p(b,d) a one-step transition matrix, assumed known. We observe the total number n(*) = n(*)(d) of emissions in each detector unit d and want to estimate the unknown lambda = lambda(b), b = 1, ..., B. For each lambda, the observed data n(*) has probability or likelihood p(n(*){\textbar}lambda). The EM algorithm of mathematical statistics starts with an initial estimate lambda(0) and gives the following simple iterative procedure for obtaining a new estimate lambdainsertion mark(new), from an old estimate lambdainsertion mark(old), to obtain lambdainsertion mark(k), k = 1, 2, ..., lambdainsertion mark(new)(b)= lambdainsertion mark(old)(b)Sum of (n(*)p(b,d) from d=1 to D/Sum of lambdainsertion mark()old(b('))p(b('),d) from b(')=1 to B), b=1,...B.},

Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is used in many biological research experiments that require fast three-dimensional (3D) imaging up to a few volumes per second. Wavefront coding (WFC) microscopy provides LSFM with 3D real-time imaging capabilities introducing a controlled aberration that extends the depth of field (DOF) of the microscope objective. Resulting images, however, are blurred and need to be processed to recover the original sharpness in a CPU-intensive deconvolution which makes real-time visualization unattainable. We present computational tools based on GPU parallel computing to achieve realtime deconvolution and visualization of the images obtained with WFC light-sheet microscopy.},

	abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for 3D imaging of biological specimens. However the acquired images are degraded by blur from out-of-focus light and Poisson noise due to photon-limited detection. Several deconvolution methods have been proposed to reduce these degradations, including the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm, which computes a maximum likelihood estimation adapted to Poisson statistics. However this algorithm does not necessarily converge to a suitable solution, as it tends to amplify noise. If it is used with a regularizing constraint (some prior knowledge on the data), Richardson-Lucy regularized with a well-chosen constraint, always converges to a suitable solution. Here, we propose to combine the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with a regularizing constraint based on Total Variation, whose smoothing avoids oscillations while preserving object edges. We show on simulated and real images that this constraint improves the deconvolution results both visually and using quantitative measures. We compare several well-known deconvolution methods to the proposed method, such as standard Richardson-Lucy (no regularization), Richardson-Lucy with Tikhonov-Miller regularization, and an additive gradient-based algorithm.},

	abstract = {A maximum likelihood based iterative algorithm adapted from nuclear medicine imaging for noncoherent optical imaging was presented in a previous publication with some initial computer-simulation testing. This algorithm is identical in form to that previously derived in a different way by W. H. Richardson "Bayesian-Based Iterative Method of Image Restoration," J. Opt. Soc. Am. 62, 55-59 (1972) and L. B. Lucy "An Iterative Technique for the Rectification of Observed Distributions," Astron. J. 79, 745-765 (1974). Foreseen applications include superresolution and 3-D fluorescence microscopy. This paper presents further simulation testing of this algorithm and a preliminary experiment with a defocused camera. The simulations show quantified resolution improvement as a function of iteration number, and they show qualitatively the trend in limitations on restored resolution when noise is present in the data. Also shown are results of a simulation in restoring missing-cone information for 3-D imaging. Conclusions are in support of the feasibility of using these methods with real systems, while computational cost and timing estimates indicate that it should be realistic to implement these methods. Itis suggested in the Appendix that future extensions to the maximum likelihood based derivation of this algorithm will address some of the limitations that are experienced with the nonextended form of the algorithm presented here.},

	abstract = {Images in fluorescence microscopy are inherently blurred due to the limit of diffraction of light. The purpose of deconvolution microscopy is to compensate numerically for this degradation. Deconvolution is widely used to restore fine details of 3D biological samples. Unfortunately, dealing with deconvolution tools is not straightforward. Among others, end users have to select the appropriate algorithm, calibration and parametrization, while potentially facing demanding computational tasks. To make deconvolution more accessible, we have developed a practical platform for deconvolution microscopy called DeconvolutionLab. Freely distributed, DeconvolutionLab hosts standard algorithms for 3D microscopy deconvolution and drives them through a user-oriented interface. In this paper, we take advantage of the release of DeconvolutionLab2 to provide a complete description of the software package and its built-in deconvolution algorithms. We examine several standard algorithms used in deconvolution microscopy, notably: Regularized inverse filter, Tikhonov regularization, Landweber, Tikhonov–Miller, Richardson–Lucy, and fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding. We evaluate these methods over large 3D microscopy images using simulated datasets and real experimental images. We distinguish the algorithms in terms of image quality, performance, usability and computational requirements. Our presentation is completed with a discussion of recent trends in deconvolution, inspired by the results of the Grand Challenge on deconvolution microscopy that was recently organized.},
